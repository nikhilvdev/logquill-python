# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Auto-instrumentation, an OpenAI Agents SDK adapter, and MCP trace propagation:
  - `logquill.instrument.anthropic(logger)` / `.openai(logger)` / `.litellm(logger)`
    patch the Anthropic, OpenAI, and litellm Python SDKs so every LLM call they
    make anywhere in the process emits a `logger.llm_call(...)` — no call-site
    changes. Each has a matching `.uninstrument()`, lives behind its own
    optional extra (`logquill[instrument-anthropic]`, `[instrument-openai]`,
    `[instrument-litellm]`), and is imported lazily: `import logquill.instrument`
    never imports a provider SDK. Streaming calls are a documented gap in this
    release — passed through untouched rather than partially instrumented.
  - `OpenAIAgentsAdapter` (`pip install logquill[openai-agents]`) maps the
    OpenAI Agents SDK's `RunHooks` the same way the existing adapters map their
    frameworks: every agent activation (including a handoff's target) is its
    own `invoke_agent` span, and `on_llm_end` becomes a real `.llm_call()` with
    token usage, so `OTLPTransport` exports a full run — spans, tokens, cost —
    with zero manual logging calls.
  - `logquill.mcp` (`propagate()`/`inbound()`) propagates trace context over an
    MCP request's `_meta` field and stamps `meta.mcp.*` on records logged while
    handling one, with no dependency on the `mcp` package itself. A client's
    `run_id` rides along informationally as `meta.mcp.run_id`; it never
    overrides the handling process's own `RunPlugin` run id.
  - The record contract gained `meta.mcp.run_id`.

- LLM calls and OpenTelemetry export:
  - `logger.llm_call(model=, tokens_in=, tokens_out=, cost_usd=, latency_ms=,
    finish_reason=)` records an LLM call with its numbers in the record's
    first-class `llm` block. A value that breaks the contract is dropped with a
    warning instead of raising.
  - `OTLPTransport` (`pip install logquill[otel]`) exports agent tracing as real
    OpenTelemetry spans through the SDK: `span()` blocks, tool `.action()`s and
    LLM calls, with the ids, parents and timings the records carry, so a
    collector shows exactly the tree that was logged. Spans are named and
    attributed per the OpenTelemetry GenAI conventions (`invoke_agent`,
    `execute_tool`, `chat`, with token counts, model and finish reason).
  - `OTelLogsTransport` sends every record as an OTLP log record, with the same
    trace and span ids so logs and spans join up.
  - The convention names live in one file, `logquill/semconv.py`, pinned to a
    named release (semantic-conventions 1.44.0), because the GenAI conventions
    are still experimental and have already renamed attributes.
    `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` is honored, `semconv_version="legacy"` picks
    the older names, and old and new names are never emitted together. Prompt
    and completion text is opt-in only.
  - `span(name, capture_state=...)` records what changed during a block as
    `meta.state_diff`, and a tool `.action()` that is reopened before it
    succeeded gets `meta.retry_count` automatically.
  - The record contract gained optional `meta` fields for this: `tool`,
    `tool_call_id`, `provider`, `agent_name`, `agent_id`, `response_model`,
    `operation`, and opt-in `input_messages` / `output_messages`.
  - Type-checking no longer depends on whether OpenTelemetry is installed.
- **Breaking: the record shape and the Python floor changed.** See
  [MIGRATING.md](MIGRATING.md).
  - logquill now requires **Python 3.10 or newer** and is tested on 3.10–3.14.
    Python 3.8 and 3.9 are end-of-life; pip on those interpreters keeps
    installing 1.x.
  - Every record now carries `schema_version` (`"2.0"`). Nothing was renamed or
    removed, so a reader only breaks if it insists on exactly the five 1.x
    keys. `parse_record()` reads 1.x and 2.x records alike, labelling a 1.x
    record `"1.0"`.
  - New reserved fields, shared with `logquill` on npm: a top-level `llm` block
    (`model`, `tokens_in`, `tokens_out`, `cost_usd`, `latency_ms`,
    `finish_reason`) for LLM calls, plus `meta.retry_count`, `meta.state_diff`
    and `meta.mcp.server`/`meta.mcp.tool`. The text and logfmt formatters show
    the `llm` block. Nothing writes these on its own yet.
  - `TamperEvidentPlugin` now covers `schema_version` and `llm` in the hash, so
    editing either is caught; hash chains written by 1.x still verify.
  - Fixed: the New Relic transport rebuilt each record from its five 1.x fields
    and would have dropped `schema_version` and `llm`; it now copies the record.
  - The record format now has a machine-readable definition,
    `schema/record.schema.json` (JSON Schema 2020-12), and a shared file of
    golden records, `schema/golden_records.json`. `tests/test_contract.py`
    checks the schema, the golden records, the parser, and everything the
    logger actually writes against each other, so drift between the Python and
    JavaScript packages now fails a test instead of relying on a reviewer to
    notice.

- Added the 1.0 features that hadn't shipped yet, plus hardening:
  - `logger.opt(lazy=True)` defers callable `meta` values until a record is
    really going to be emitted, so an expensive `DEBUG`/`TRACE` argument costs
    nothing when the level filters the call out. A callable that raises leaves
    a placeholder in the record instead of crashing the caller.
    `logger.opt(depth=N)` adds `meta.caller` (`module`, `function`, `line`,
    `file`) naming the code that logged, `N` frames up, so a call made from a
    wrapper or decorator reports the wrapper's caller.
  - `logquill.disable(name)` / `logquill.enable(name)` switch off a logger and
    everything nested under it (most specific rule wins), so a library that
    logs through LogQuill can be silent in its host application by default —
    `logquill.disable(__name__)` — and the application can turn it back on.
  - Two new formatters: `TextFormatter` (a human-readable entry per record,
    with tracebacks on the lines below) and `LogfmtFormatter` (single-line
    `key=value` output; values are quoted so a record is always one line).
    Formatters now live in the `logquill.formatters` package;
    `logquill.formatter` still works. A transport's `options` in a config file
    can name one: `{"formatter": "text"}`. `logquill tail` now prints
    tracebacks the same way `TextFormatter` does.
  - `parse(source, pattern, cast=...)` extracts structured fields from a log
    file with a regex — including legacy and third-party formats — streaming
    line by line. `parse_logfmt()` reads logfmt back, and `TEXT_LOG_PATTERN`
    reads `TextFormatter` output.
  - `AppriseAlertPlugin` (`pip install logquill[apprise]`) sends alerts
    through Apprise, reaching 100+ notification services with the same
    deduplication and non-blocking behavior as the other alerting plugins.
  - Every `Logger` now flushes and closes its transports at interpreter exit
    (an `atexit` hook), so a script that never calls `close()` no longer loses
    its last queued records or a batching transport's unsent batch. Opt out
    with `Logger(flush_at_exit=False)` or `"flush_at_exit": false` in config.
  - `diagnose=True` on any `Logger` method adds each traceback frame's local
    variable values. Off by default, with an explicit warning in the docs and
    once per process in the log: it can leak sensitive data. Captured values
    go through `RedactPlugin` and `PIIRedactPlugin` *before* the traceback is
    formatted (via a new optional `Plugin.redact_local` hook), and a plugin
    whose hook raises masks the value instead of showing it.
  - `HTTPTransport(backend="aiohttp")` sends over one reused keep-alive
    connection, giving the `http` extra a purpose. Also, `HTTPTransport` now
    bounds its buffer by `max_bytes` as well as `batch_size`, and a failed
    send is logged with an actionable message and the batch dropped, rather
    than raising into the code that logged.
  - Fixed: the async queue's "dropping records" warning could stay silent for
    the first minute after a process started, because its rate limiter
    compared against a monotonic clock whose zero point is arbitrary.
  - Fixed: passing a malformed `exc_info` (for example a forwarded dict that
    happens to carry a bad `exc_info` key) raised out of the log call. It is
    now ignored with a warning, like any other bad `meta`.
  - A memory-budget suite (`pytest benchmarks`, its own CI job) fails the
    build if a log call, a level-filtered call, or a burst into a stalled
    sink uses materially more memory than it does today. New tests burst
    30,000 records at a stalled transport under each backpressure policy and
    assert exactly which records survive, and `hypothesis` coverage now
    extends to the formatters and transports.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-05

- First stable release: bumped the `Development Status` classifier from
  `3 - Alpha` to `5 - Production/Stable`, matching `1.0.0`.
- Packaging polish:
  - Confirmed the `py.typed` marker ships correctly inside the built wheel
    (verified by installing that wheel into a fresh virtualenv and running
    `mypy --strict` against a script importing the installed package, not
    the local checkout) and that `pyproject.toml`'s keywords, project
    URLs, and optional-dependency extras were already complete.
  - Fixed a real sdist-packaging bug found while verifying the above: the
    sdist was bundling whatever untracked local files happened to sit in
    the working tree at build time — including the local `hypothesis`
    test cache (`.hypothesis/`, 145 files) and other per-machine tool
    state — alongside the actual source, since `hatchling`'s default
    sdist selection includes anything not explicitly `.gitignore`d, and
    not every local artifact was. Replaced that with an explicit
    `[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]` allowlist naming exactly the
    paths the package needs (`logquill/`, `tests/`, docs, license,
    `pyproject.toml`), so a sdist built from any contributor's machine
    stays limited to actual project files regardless of what else is
    sitting in the working tree.
  - Verified `python -m build` produces a clean wheel and sdist, `twine
    check dist/*` passes on both, and installing the built wheel into a
    fresh virtualenv works end to end — import, logging calls, and the
    `logquill` CLI entry point all function against the installed package.
- Phase 9, docs, complete:
  - Every public class and function across the package now has a docstring
    explaining what it does and why you'd reach for it — not a restatement
    of its name — matching the bar already set by the existing public API.
  - A full API reference, generated straight from those docstrings with
    [pdoc](https://pdoc.dev) (`pip install logquill[docs]`), is published to
    GitHub Pages and rebuilt automatically on every push to `main` via
    `.github/workflows/docs.yml`.
  - README: a new "Kubernetes" section explains why `ConsoleTransport`
    (stdout/stderr, captured by the node's log agent) belongs in a
    container instead of `FileTransport` (writes to an ephemeral
    filesystem nothing aggregates), and how to avoid losing queued records
    to `SIGTERM` when `async_dispatch=True` is combined with a container's
    termination grace period.
- Phase 8, CLI, complete:
  - `logquill tail <file> [--level=] [--json] [-f/--follow] [-n/--lines]` — a
    `logquill` console-script for tailing a JSONL log file in local dev.
    Human-readable output by default, colorized by level to match
    `ConsoleTransport`; `--json` prints each matching record as a raw JSON
    line instead. `--level` filters to that level and above; `-n` limits to
    the last N matching records; `-f`/`--follow` keeps polling the file for
    newly appended records, for a `tail -f`-style live view. A line that
    isn't valid JSON, or isn't a JSON object, is skipped with a warning on
    stderr instead of aborting the whole tail.
- Phase 7, advanced context & stdlib bridge, complete:
  - `bind_context(**values)` — a `contextvars`-based context manager that
    merges `values` into every `Logger` call underneath it, through any
    method and any number of function calls deep, without threading them
    through each signature by hand. Isolated per thread/asyncio task;
    nested blocks merge, with the innermost value winning on key collision
    (an explicit call-site `meta` value still wins over anything bound this
    way). `current_context()` reads the merged dict directly.
  - `exc_info=` on every `Logger` method (`logger.error("failed",
    exc_info=e)`) — accepts the same shapes stdlib `logging` does (an
    exception instance, `True` for the exception currently being handled,
    or an explicit `(type, value, traceback)` tuple), formats a traceback
    into `meta["stack"]`, and is never kept in `meta` as the raw exception
    object, since that isn't serializable. `format_exc_info()` is exported
    directly for anything that wants the same formatting standalone.
  - `LogQuillHandler` — a `logging.Handler` subclass that bridges stdlib
    `logging` calls (including from third-party libraries) into a LogQuill
    `Logger`, so they flow through the same transports and plugin pipeline
    as a native `.info()`/`.error()`/... call. `extra=` fields land in
    `meta`; an attached `exc_info` is formatted into `meta["stack"]` the
    same way the `Logger`'s own `exc_info=` kwarg is. Level filtering still
    applies on top of whatever the stdlib logger/handler's own level is set to.
  - `RateLimitPlugin(max_records, per_seconds)` — drops records once a key
    (by default `(logger, level)`, or a custom `key_func`) exceeds
    `max_records` within a rolling per-key window, to cap a noisy loop
    without silencing the logger's other messages. Bounded by `max_keys`
    distinct keys tracked at once, evicting the least-recently-seen key's
    window to make room for a new one.
- Phase 6, async worker, shutdown & serverless safety, complete:
  - `AsyncWorker` — a bounded, in-memory queue backed by a single daemon
    thread, with a configurable `backpressure` policy for what happens once
    that bound is hit under a sustained burst: `drop_oldest` (default,
    evicts the oldest queued item), `drop_newest` (discards the item that
    just overflowed the queue), or `block` (the submitting thread waits for
    space instead of dropping anything). Either drop policy logs at most one
    warning per minute while actively dropping, not one per drop.
  - `Logger(async_dispatch=True, max_queue_size=10_000, backpressure=
    "drop_oldest")` — moves each record's transport writes and `after_log`
    plugin hooks onto that background thread, so `.info()`/`.error()`/...
    return without waiting on a transport's I/O; `before_log` hooks still
    run synchronously, since a later hook or transport needs to see their
    result in order. `Logger.child()` shares its parent's worker rather than
    starting a second background thread.
  - `Logger.flush(timeout=None)` / `await Logger.flush_async(timeout=None)`
    — drain any queued records and flush each transport's own internal
    buffer (`Transport.flush()`, a new no-op-by-default hook; already
    matched by `BatchingTransport`'s existing buffered-batch flush) without
    closing anything, so the logger stays usable right after. `Logger.close
    (timeout=5.0)` now drains the queue (up to `timeout`) before closing
    every transport.
  - `with_lambda(logger_or_loggers, timeout=5.0)` — wraps a handler so
    `flush()`/`flush_async()` runs before the handler's result or exception
    reaches the caller, covering both sync and `async def` handlers.
    Flushes rather than closes, since a warm serverless container reuses
    the same `Logger`/transports on its next invocation. `with_cloud_function`
    and `with_azure_function` are the same decorator under a name that
    reads naturally at each platform's own handler definition — the
    flush-before-return behavior needed is identical across all three.
  - `load_config`/`logger_from_file`/`logger_from_env` accept the new
    `"async_dispatch"`/`"max_queue_size"`/`"backpressure"` config keys,
    mapped straight onto the matching `Logger` constructor arguments.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-09-01

- `LangGraphAdapter` (`pip install logquill[langgraph]`) — corrects an
  overstatement in the 0.4.0 entry below: LangGraph nodes run as ordinary
  LangChain `Runnable`s, so `LangChainAdapter` alone already captures node
  execution, but LangGraph also has its own checkpoint lifecycle —
  `on_interrupt`/`on_resume`, fired when a graph pauses on an `interrupt()`
  call (e.g. for human review) and later resumes from a persisted
  checkpoint — that LangGraph dispatches only to handlers that are
  instances of its own `GraphCallbackHandler`; a plain `BaseCallbackHandler`
  subclass (all `LangChainAdapter` is) never receives them. `LangGraphAdapter`
  is `LangChainAdapter` plus those two, mapped to `.observation
  ("graph_interrupted", ...)`/`.action("graph_resumed", ...)` carrying
  `checkpoint_id`/`status`/`checkpoint_ns`/pending `Interrupt` payloads, with
  the event's own `run_id` as `parent_span_id`. `pip install
  logquill[langgraph]` pulls in a compatible `langchain-core` transitively;
  `langgraph` is never imported unless `logquill.adapters.langgraph` is
  imported explicitly.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-09-01

- Closed three gaps found auditing Phases 1–3 against their own written
  exit criteria (each had been marked "shipped" despite this):
  - Phase 1: config loading from file/env. `load_config(dict)`,
    `logger_from_file(path)` (JSON built in; YAML via the optional
    `pip install logquill[yaml]`), and `logger_from_env(prefix=
    "LOGQUILL_")` build a `Logger` from `{"name", "level", "transports":
    [{"type"|"class", "options"}], "plugins": [...]}`. A small built-in
    `"type"` registry covers the zero-dependency transports/plugins;
    anything else (every cloud/SQL/NoSQL/queue transport, the alerting
    plugins, framework adapters, your own subclass) goes through `"class"`
    — a fully-qualified dotted path, resolved the same way `logging.
    config.dictConfig` resolves one. `{prefix}LEVEL` in the environment
    always overrides a config file's level.
  - Phase 2: `FileTransport(encrypt_key=...)` encrypts each line with
    `cryptography.fernet.Fernet` before writing — worth doing here
    specifically because cloud transports typically already encrypt
    server-side, but a local log file on disk usually doesn't. Optional
    `pip install logquill[crypto]`, imported lazily.
  - Phase 3: `SyslogTransport` — RFC 5424 messages over UDP (default) or
    TCP, stdlib `socket` only, no dependency. Not a batching transport,
    unlike the HTTP-API cloud transports: syslog is one-datagram/one-
    message-per-call.
- Fixed a pre-existing crash the plugin-pipeline hypothesis property test
  caught during this audit, unrelated to the three gaps above: any of
  `Logger`'s message-taking methods (`.info()`, `.error()`, `.action()`,
  ...) raised `TypeError: got multiple values for argument 'message'` if
  the caller's `**meta` happened to contain a key literally named
  `"message"` (and `.child()`/`.span()` had the same issue with `"name"`)
  — exactly the kind of caller-crashing bug those hypothesis tests exist
  to catch. `message`/`name` are now positional-only on every affected
  method, so a `meta`/`fixed_meta` key with that exact name now flows
  through as ordinary meta instead of colliding.
- Phase 5, trace correlation & agentic tracing, complete:
  - `Logger.child(name, **fixed_meta)` — a namespaced logger sharing the
    parent's transports, with its own plugin pipeline and optional fixed
    context injected into every record.
  - `.thought()/.action()/.observation()/.decision()` — `.info()` with
    `meta.kind` pre-set, for tagging agent reasoning steps.
  - `Logger.span(name)`, used as `with agent_log.span("call_llm"):` —
    emits one record on exit carrying `meta.span_id`/`meta.duration_ms`;
    every record logged inside the block (through any method) is
    automatically stamped with `meta.parent_span_id`, so a full run
    reconstructs its exact nesting by sorting on `span_id`/`parent_span_id`.
    Still emits its record, at `ERROR` with `meta.error` set, if the block
    raises — the exception itself propagates unchanged.
  - `RunPlugin` — stamps `meta.run_id` (generated if not given) and an
    incrementing `meta.step`; one instance scopes one run, so concurrent
    runs never share a counter.
  - `TraceContextPlugin` — stamps `meta.trace_id` for cross-service
    correlation, distinct from `run_id`. Resolves an active OpenTelemetry
    span's trace id first (best-effort, lazy import), then a W3C
    `traceparent`/AWS X-Ray/GCP trace header propagated via the new
    `set_traceparent()`/`reset_traceparent()` (a `contextvars`-based
    per-thread/asyncio-task mechanism), and generates a fresh id only if
    neither is available.
  - `LogQuillAdapter` base class + `LangChainAdapter`
    (`pip install logquill[langchain]`) — maps LangChain's
    `BaseCallbackHandler` events onto the calls above; covers LangGraph
    for free, since it shares LangChain's callback system. LangChain's own
    `run_id`/`parent_run_id` are written directly onto
    `meta.span_id`/`meta.parent_span_id`. `langchain-core` is never
    imported unless `logquill.adapters.langchain` is imported explicitly.
- `CrewAIAdapter` (`pip install logquill[crewai]`) — a second
  `LogQuillAdapter` implementation, ahead of the phase schedule (CrewAI was
  listed as a Phase 5 follow-on, not required for that phase). Listens on
  CrewAI's own event bus (`BaseEventListener`) rather than a single
  callback handler; a crew kickoff and each task open/close a `.span()`,
  while agent execution, tool usage, and LLM calls become `.action()`/
  `.observation()`/`.error()` pairs with `duration_ms`. Correlation reads
  directly off CrewAI's own `event.parent_event_id`/`event.started_event_id`
  (populated by CrewAI's own `contextvars`-backed scope stack) rather than
  tracking anything independently — the same field-renaming approach
  `LangChainAdapter` takes with LangChain's `run_id`/`parent_run_id`.
  `crewai` is never imported unless `logquill.adapters.crewai` is imported
  explicitly.
- `LlamaIndexAdapter` (`pip install logquill[llamaindex]`) — a third
  `LogQuillAdapter` implementation. LlamaIndex's own instrumentation module
  splits into two cooperating registrations on a shared dispatcher, so this
  adapter holds one of each rather than being a handler itself: a span
  handler for LlamaIndex's own method-level calls (`query()`, `chat()`,
  `retrieve()`, ...), each becoming a `span_id`/`duration_ms` record with
  `parent_span_id` set for a nested call; and an event handler for named
  events fired *within* those calls, classified generically by class-name
  suffix (`*StartEvent` -> `.action()`, `*EndEvent` -> `.observation()`,
  `*ErrorEvent` -> `.error()`) rather than enumerated one by one, so a new
  LlamaIndex event type needs no adapter change to show up correctly.
  `llama-index-core` is never imported unless `logquill.adapters.llamaindex`
  is imported explicitly.
- `AutoGenAdapter` (`pip install logquill[autogen]`) — a fourth
  `LogQuillAdapter` implementation, rounding out every framework CLAUDE.md
  names as a Phase 5 follow-on. Architecturally different from the other
  three: (Microsoft) AutoGen's actual integration point is a stdlib
  `logging.Handler` attached to `autogen_core.EVENT_LOGGER_NAME`, where
  model clients and tools log structured event objects (not strings), so
  the adapter is a `Handler` whose `emit()` unpacks that object rather than
  a callback/event-bus registration. Each event becomes a flat
  `.action()`/`.observation()`/`.error()` record; unlike the other three
  adapters, AutoGen's structured events carry no call-level
  `span_id`/`parent_span_id`-equivalent (only `agent_id`), so there's no
  span tree to reconstruct here — documented as a real limitation, not
  glossed over. Covers `autogen-core`/`autogen-agentchat` only — **not
  AG2**, which forked from AutoGen and, as of its 2026 rewrite, moved onto
  its own event-driven architecture sharing none of this (confirmed against
  its source: zero references to `EVENT_LOGGER_NAME`); unlike LangGraph
  sharing LangChain's callback system, this is a genuine divergence and AG2
  would need its own adapter. `autogen-core` is never imported unless
  `logquill.adapters.autogen` is imported explicitly.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-31

- Plugin pipeline, Phase 4 complete: `SamplingPlugin` gained tail-based
  elevation — with `transports=` set, a record that would be dropped is
  buffered per `meta["trace_id"]` (configurable via `trace_key`) instead of
  discarded outright, and if any later record in that trace reaches
  `elevate_at` (default `ERROR`), the whole trace — every buffered record
  plus everything after — ships, flushed straight to `transports`. Buffering
  is bounded by `max_buffered_records` and `max_traces`, oldest trace
  evicted first. Without `transports`, behavior is unchanged from plain
  rate-based sampling.
- `Logger.use()` (and the `plugins=[...]` constructor list) now accepts a
  plain function alongside a `Plugin` instance — wrapped internally as an
  anonymous `Plugin` (`FunctionPlugin`) — so a one-off `before_log`-style
  transform doesn't require subclassing `Plugin` first.
- `PIIRedactPlugin`: regex-based PII redaction over `meta` **values**
  (emails, SSNs, credit-card numbers, phone numbers), recursing through
  nested dicts/lists/tuples and matching regardless of which key holds the
  value — complements `RedactPlugin`'s exact-key matching. Depth- and
  cycle-bounded, so a circular reference or pathologically deep structure
  can't hang or crash the caller. An opt-in `use_presidio=True` mode
  (`pip install logquill[presidio]`) routes values through Microsoft
  Presidio's analyzer/anonymizer instead, for ML-based detection; Presidio
  is imported lazily and stays a real, non-default dependency.
- `TamperEvidentPlugin`: hash-chains every record (`meta.hash` over the
  record's own content plus the previous record's `meta.hash`, stored as
  `meta.prev_hash`), so editing, removing, or reordering a line in a
  written log breaks the chain from that point on. Ships with a static
  `TamperEvidentPlugin.verify_chain(records)` to check a log after the
  fact. Opt-in — hashing every record has a real, measurable CPU cost.
- `AlertingPlugin` base class + `SlackAlertPlugin`, `PagerDutyAlertPlugin`,
  and `EmailAlertPlugin`: fires on ERROR/FATAL (or any configurable
  `threshold`), with the actual send always running on a background
  thread so a slow or unreachable destination can never block the log call
  that triggered it. Repeated identical errors (same level + logger +
  message by default, or a custom `dedupe_key`) within
  `dedupe_window_seconds` collapse into one follow-up alert carrying an
  occurrence count instead of spamming the destination once per record.
  `send_alert` failures are caught and routed to the plugin's own
  `on_error`, same as any other plugin hook. Tracking is bounded to
  `max_tracked_keys` concurrent dedupe windows — alerting degrades under
  extreme cardinality, logging itself never does. All three concrete
  plugins use only the stdlib (`urllib`, `smtplib`) — no new required
  dependency.
- Fixed a pre-existing gap surfaced by a new property-based test (see
  below): `Logger`'s per-transport dispatch had no error handling, so a
  transport that failed to format or write a given record (e.g.
  `JSONFormatter` on a `meta` value containing a circular reference) would
  propagate the exception straight to the caller. Now caught and logged via
  the same `logging.getLogger("logquill")` channel `BatchingTransport`
  already uses, per transport, so one broken transport can't crash the
  caller or stop other attached transports from receiving the record.
- Added a `hypothesis`-based property test (new `dev` dependency) that
  drives the plugin pipeline (`ContextPlugin`, `RedactPlugin`,
  `PIIRedactPlugin`, `TamperEvidentPlugin`) with adversarial `meta` —
  deeply nested structures, unusual scalar types, non-JSON-serializable
  values, and circular references — asserting the pipeline never crashes
  the caller, only ever fails closed.

- New transports: SQL (`BaseSQLTransport` + `SQLiteTransport`,
  `PostgresTransport`, `MySQLTransport`), NoSQL (`MongoDBTransport`,
  `DynamoDBTransport`, `RedisTransport`), message queues
  (`BaseQueueTransport` + `KafkaTransport`, `RabbitMQTransport`,
  `SQSTransport`, `PubSubTransport`), and cloud-native sinks
  (`CloudWatchTransport`, `CloudLoggingTransport`, `AppInsightsTransport`,
  `DatadogTransport`, `ElasticsearchTransport`, `NewRelicTransport`) —
  full parity with `logquill-js` 0.2.0. All of it sits on a new shared
  `BatchingTransport` base that bounds its buffer by both record count and
  estimated byte size, swaps the buffer out before sending so a
  synchronous re-entrant flush can't double-send, and catches a failing
  send rather than propagating it to the caller (logged via Python's
  stdlib `logging.getLogger("logquill")`) — a slow or down sink can't
  crash the process. Every optional backend driver (`psycopg2-binary`,
  `pymysql`, `pymongo`, `boto3`, `redis`, `kafka-python`, `pika`,
  `google-cloud-pubsub`, `google-cloud-logging`) is a lazy, injectable
  dependency behind a new `pyproject.toml` extra (`postgres`, `mysql`,
  `mongodb`, `redis`, `kafka`, `rabbitmq`, `pubsub`, `gcp-logging`, and a
  shared `aws` extra for CloudWatch/DynamoDB/SQS, all boto3-backed); a
  missing driver raises an actionable `ImportError` rather than a
  cryptic one, and every test injects a hand-written fake instead of
  requiring a live service. `SQLiteTransport` needs no extra at all
  (stdlib `sqlite3`).

  Two deliberate departures from `logquill-js`'s implementation, same
  outward behavior: `AppInsightsTransport` posts to Application Insights'
  public ingestion endpoint via stdlib `urllib` instead of an Azure SDK
  dependency, and `SQSTransport` dispatches its 10-message chunks
  sequentially rather than concurrently, since this project's dispatch is
  still fully synchronous end to end (true concurrency arrives once a
  non-blocking async worker exists). `SyslogTransport` isn't included
  here either, matching `logquill-js` 0.2.0, which didn't ship it; it's a
  shared follow-up for both packages, not a Python-only gap.

  Also restructured `logquill/transport.py`, `console_transport.py`,
  `file_transport.py`, and `http_transport.py` into a new
  `logquill/transports/` subpackage (with `sql/`, `nosql/`, `queue/`, and
  `cloud/` subpackages) to hold the 17 new transports — a pure move, the
  public `from logquill import ...` surface is unchanged.

- Plugin pipeline: `Plugin` base (`before_log`/`after_log`/`on_error`,
  all optional to override), `ContextPlugin` (merges fixed context into
  `meta`), `RedactPlugin` (replaces sensitive `meta` values by key, case-
  insensitive), and `SamplingPlugin` (probabilistically drops records).
  `Logger` now accepts `plugins=[...]` and gained `.use(plugin)` to register
  one and chain. A plugin hook that raises is caught, routed to that same
  plugin's `on_error`, and the pipeline continues — a broken plugin can't
  crash logging, verified by test.
- Added `.github/dependabot.yml`: weekly version updates for `pip`
  dependencies and GitHub Actions.
- Added GitHub issue templates: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`,
  `feature_request.yml`, and a `config.yml` that points security reports at
  private vulnerability reporting instead of a public issue.
- Added `.github/SECURITY.md`: supported-versions policy and instructions
  to report vulnerabilities via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
  instead of public issues. Linked from the README.
- Transports: `Transport` base (`format`/`write`/`close`), `ConsoleTransport`
  (colorized, ERROR/FATAL to stderr), `FileTransport` (size-based rotation), and
  `HTTPTransport` (batched, newline-delimited JSON over stdlib `urllib`, with an
  injectable `sender` for tests or alternate backends). `Logger` now accepts
  `transports=[...]` and dispatches each record to them synchronously, and gained
  `.close()` to close all attached transports. Dispatch is still synchronous —
  a non-blocking queue/async path isn't implemented yet. Also added
  `CollectingTransport`, an in-memory transport for tests.
- Added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2.1), `.github/CODEOWNERS`,
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` documenting the
  PR workflow (branch naming, scoping, review/CI requirements, squash-merge).
- Core API: `Level` (TRACE/DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR/FATAL, matching
  logquill-js's numeric weights), `parse_level()`, the `LogRecord` shape,
  `Logger` with `.trace()/.debug()/.info()/.warn()/.error()/.fatal()` and
  `.set_level()`, and a `Formatter` protocol with a `JSONFormatter`
  implementation. Log calls return the record dict (or `None` when filtered
  by level) — no transports or dispatch yet.
- Repo scaffold: `pyproject.toml`, package skeleton, dev tooling (ruff, mypy --strict, pytest), pre-commit hooks, and CI workflow.
- Packaging metadata: expanded classifiers (OS, Topic) and keywords, added an `Issues` project URL, and fixed the `Homepage`/`Repository`/`Changelog` URLs to point at the actual `nikhilvdev/logquill-python` GitHub repo instead of a stale placeholder org.
- Added a pepy.tech download-count badge to the README for tracking installs.
