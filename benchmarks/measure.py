"""Memory measurements for the logging hot path, and the budgets CI holds them to.

These measure bytes and object counts, not wall-clock time: allocation
numbers are close to deterministic for a given interpreter, so a budget can
fail the build on a real regression without flaking on a busy CI runner the
way a timing threshold would.

Run them with `pytest benchmarks`. They're kept out of the default `pytest`
run (and out of the coverage job) because line tracing distorts allocation
counts.
