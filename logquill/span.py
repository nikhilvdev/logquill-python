    `current_span_id()` on every call, so nesting falls out of ordinary
    `with`-block scoping rather than anything `SpanContext` tracks itself.

    Backed by a `contextvars.ContextVar` rather than a plain attribute so
    concurrent asyncio tasks sharing one `Logger` don't see each other's
    span nesting.

    `span_id`/`parent_span_id` are normally left to auto-generate/auto-nest,

    id it already received (LangChain's `run_id`/`parent_run_id`) directly
    onto this span, rather than minting a new, unrelated id.
