"""Changing a `Logger`'s level at runtime, without restarting the process.

Three independent mechanisms, matching what a deployment commonly has
available — pick whichever fits; none of them needs the other two:

- `install_signal_level_handler` — an OS signal (`kill -USR1 <pid>`)
  re-reads an environment variable and applies it.
- `LevelFileWatcher` — a background thread polls a file an orchestrator
  (or you, by hand) writes a level name into.
- `LevelEnvWatcher` — a background thread polls an environment variable
  something *inside* this same process updates (a config-reload callback,
  `python-dotenv` with `override=True`, ...). An OS-level environment
  change made from *outside* the process is never visible to code already
  running inside it — that's a real, unavoidable limit of what an
  environment variable is, not a gap in this watcher; use the file or
  signal mechanism for anything triggered externally.

An unrecognized or missing value is ignored with a warning in every case —
none of these may ever raise out of a signal handler or a background
thread.
