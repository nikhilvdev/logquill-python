"""Trace-context propagation over MCP (Model Context Protocol) requests, plus
stamping `meta.mcp.*` on records logged while handling one.

No dependency on the `mcp` package: both helpers just build or read a plain
`dict[str, str]`, since that is exactly what an MCP client's `meta=` argument
and a server handler's inbound request `_meta` are — the MCP spec's `_meta`
field is a generic metadata bag any request, notification or result may
carry (see the spec's "General fields" / `_meta` section). The client passes
`propagate()`'s result as `meta=` on its call; the server passes the request's
inbound `_meta` (in the Python SDK, `ctx.request_context.meta`) to `inbound()`.

Keys are namespaced under `logquill/`, a plain, unreserved `_meta` prefix —
the spec reserves only prefixes containing a `modelcontextprotocol`/`mcp`
label, and `logquill/traceparent` doesn't.
