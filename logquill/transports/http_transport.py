    Uses `urllib` (stdlib) by default so the core package stays

    over a reused keep-alive connection instead — see `AiohttpSender`. Pass
    `sender` to swap in a fake for tests, or any other backend.

    The buffer is bounded by both `batch_size` records and `max_bytes` of
    formatted text — a flush fires as soon as either is reached — so a few
    huge records can't grow it without limit. A failed send is logged and
    that batch is dropped, never raised into the code that logged; the
    transport keeps accepting records, so a down endpoint costs completeness,
    not the process.
