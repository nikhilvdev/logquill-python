    r"""Extract structured fields from a log file with a regex, yielding one
    dict per matching line — including logs LogQuill didn't write (legacy
    apps, third-party tools), which is the reason to reach for this over
    `json.loads`:

        pattern = r"(?P<when>\S+ \S+) \[(?P<level>[A-Z]+)\] (?P<code>\d+) (?P<message>.*)"
        for entry in parse("legacy.log", pattern, cast={"code": int}):
            if entry["level"] == "ERROR" and entry["code"] >= 500:
                print(entry["when"], entry["message"])

    `source` is a path (`str` or `os.PathLike`), or any iterable of lines
    such as an open file or `sys.stdin`. `pattern` must contain at least one
    named group, `(?P<name>...)`; each yielded dict maps group names to the
    matched text (`None` for an optional group that didn't participate).
    Lines that don't match are skipped. `cast` maps group names to a
    function applied to that group's text (`{"status": int}`); a group that
    is `None` is left as is.

    Streams line by line, so memory stays flat however large the file is.
    A pattern is matched against one line at a time, so it can't span
    multiple lines (e.g. a wrapped traceback).

    Raises `ValueError` immediately for a pattern with no named groups or a
    `cast` key that isn't one, and — while iterating — if a `cast` function
    rejects a value, naming the line number so the entry can be found.
