class AsyncWorker:
    """Background-thread dispatch queue backing `Logger(async_dispatch=True)`.

    A single daemon thread pulls submitted work items (closures) off a
    bounded, in-memory queue and runs them one at a time, so `submit()`
    returns to the caller without waiting on whatever the item actually
    does (e.g. a transport's blocking I/O) — that's the whole point: a log
    call's caller never blocks on the sink.

    `max_queue_size` bounds memory: a stalled or slow consumer (a down
    HTTP sink, a full disk) can't grow this queue without limit. `backpressure`
    decides what happens once that bound is hit:

    - `"drop_oldest"` (default) — evict the oldest queued item to make room
      for the new one. Favors recent records over old ones and never blocks
      the submitting thread.
    - `"drop_newest"` — discard the item just submitted instead. Favors
      records already queued over the newest one.
    - `"block"` — the submitting thread waits for space. Favors completeness
      over the non-blocking guarantee; only choose this if the caller can
      tolerate an occasional stall.

    Either drop policy logs at most one warning per minute while actively
    dropping, not one per dropped item.
