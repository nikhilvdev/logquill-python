# `type: ignore[misc]` — same reason as every other adapter here:

    """`LangChainAdapter` plus LangGraph's own checkpoint pause/resume events.

    `LangChainAdapter` alone already covers everything that happens *inside*
    a LangGraph node — nodes execute as ordinary LangChain `Runnable`s, so
    `on_chain_start`/`on_llm_start`/`on_tool_start`/etc. all fire exactly as
    they would for a plain chain. What a plain `BaseCallbackHandler` cannot
    see is LangGraph's own checkpoint lifecycle: `on_interrupt`/`on_resume`,
    fired when a graph pauses on an `interrupt()` call (e.g. for human
    review) and later resumes from a persisted checkpoint. LangGraph
    dispatches those two specifically to handlers that are instances of its
    own `GraphCallbackHandler` — a plain `BaseCallbackHandler` subclass
    (which is all `LangChainAdapter` is) never receives them, silently. This
    class exists for that reason alone; everything else is inherited
    unchanged from `LangChainAdapter`.

        from logquill import Logger, RunPlugin
        from logquill.adapters.langgraph import LangGraphAdapter

        log = Logger("app")
        handler = LangGraphAdapter(log.child("agent").use(RunPlugin()))
        graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
        graph.invoke(input, config={"callbacks": [handler], "configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}})

    `on_interrupt` becomes `.observation("graph_interrupted", ...)` carrying
    `checkpoint_id`, `status`, `checkpoint_ns` (the subgraph namespace path,
    if nested), and each pending `Interrupt`'s `id`/`value`; `on_resume`
    becomes `.action("graph_resumed", ...)` with the same checkpoint fields.
    Both use `event.run_id` as `parent_span_id`, matching the enclosing
    graph's own chain span from `LangChainAdapter.on_chain_start` — the
    graph hasn't ended, just paused, so its span is still open.

    `pip install logquill[langgraph]` — pulls in a compatible `langchain-core`
    transitively, so installing this extra alone is enough; `langgraph` is
    never imported unless you import `logquill.adapters.langgraph` yourself.
