class AdaptiveSamplingPlugin(Plugin):
    """Keeps every error and every "slow" span unconditionally, samples
    everything else, and caps how many bytes of that ordinary traffic pass
    through in any one second — adjusting how much it keeps as traffic
    rises and falls, rather than a single fixed rate.

    - **Always kept**: a record at `keep_at` (default `ERROR`) or above, and
      a span record (`meta.kind == "span"`) whose `meta.duration_ms` reaches
      `slow_ms` (default 1000) — the two categories you can't afford to
      lose to sampling, independent of the budget below.
    - **Everything else** is rate-sampled at this plugin's *current* rate
      (starting at `base_rate`), then checked against a rolling
      one-second byte budget (`max_bytes_per_second`, estimated the same
      way `BatchingTransport` estimates buffered size — JSON-encoded
      length). A record that passes the rate check but would push the
      current second over budget is dropped anyway.
    - **Adaptive**: at the end of each one-second window, the rate adjusts
      based on *demand* — the byte size of every record that passed the
      rate check that window, whether or not the budget gate then also let
      it through — against the budget: well under it raises the rate (more
      gets through), over it lowers the rate (bounded to `[min_rate,
      max_rate]`). Demand, not bytes actually emitted, is what the
      adjustment has to track: once the budget is saturated, emitted bytes
      stop growing no matter how much more is being asked for, so using
      emitted bytes as the signal would read a saturated gate as "plenty of
      room" and keep raising the rate into an already-over-budget window.

    `rng`/`clock` are injectable for deterministic tests; they default to
    `random.random`/`time.monotonic`.
