class FlightRecorderPlugin(Plugin):
    """A bounded, per-run ring buffer of low-level records, shipped only if
    that run later errors — generalizing `SamplingPlugin`'s tail-based
    elevation from "a record sampling happened to drop" to "a record below
    the level you actually want shipped, period."

    The idea: run a logger at `DEBUG`/`TRACE` so fine-grained context is
    always *available*, but don't pay to ship that volume to a transport
    for every run — only for the runs that turn out to matter. A record at
    or above `ship_at` (default `INFO`) goes straight through, same as
    without this plugin. A record below `ship_at` is instead buffered under
    its `meta[run_key]`. If any later record for that same run reaches
    `flush_at` (default `ERROR`), every buffered record for that run is
    flushed straight to `transports` and the run ships unconditionally from
    then on — so a failing run ships its full `DEBUG` trail, and a passing
    one never pays to ship any of it.

    Flushing writes directly to `transports` (the same list given to the
    `Logger`), bypassing `before_log`/`after_log` for any plugin *after*
    this one in the pipeline, the same tradeoff `SamplingPlugin` makes —
    put `FlightRecorderPlugin` last if that matters for your pipeline.

    Buffering is bounded: at most `max_buffered_records` records total and
    `max_runs` distinct run ids are held at once. Once either limit is hit,
    the oldest buffered run is evicted (and lost, not flushed) — a
    deliberate bounded-memory trade-off: an unbounded per-run buffer would
    let one pathologically long or high-cardinality run grow memory without
    limit, which is exactly the failure mode this plugin exists to avoid
    while still keeping DEBUG-level detail available for runs that error.
    A record with no `meta[run_key]` isn't part of any run this plugin can
    buffer, so it's just passed through as-is regardless of level.
