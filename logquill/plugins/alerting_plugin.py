class AlertingPlugin(Plugin):
    """Base class for plugins that fire an external alert on ERROR/FATAL (or
    any configurable `threshold`).

    A concrete subclass implements only `send_alert(record, occurrences)` —
    everything else (thresholding, deduplication, never blocking the
    caller, never letting a broken destination crash logging) lives here.

    The first record at or above `threshold` for a given dedupe key (by
    default: level + logger + message) fires `send_alert` right away, on a
    short-lived background thread — so the log call that triggered it is
    never blocked on a webhook, SMTP handshake, or any other I/O, even if
    the destination is slow or unreachable. This plugin spawns its own
    thread per alert rather than routing through `Logger`'s shared
    `AsyncWorker` (see `logquill/worker.py`), since a plugin hook runs
    before dispatch is decided and has no handle on that queue; unifying
    the two is a possible future simplification, not a correctness gap.

    Any further record matching the same dedupe key within
    `dedupe_window_seconds` of the first is *not* sent again — it just
    increments a counter. When the window closes, if more than one record
    matched, exactly one follow-up alert is sent with the total occurrence
    count, instead of spamming the destination once per record. Tracking is
    bounded to `max_tracked_keys` distinct concurrent dedupe keys; beyond
    that, new keys are dropped rather than tracked (alerting degrades under
    extreme cardinality, logging itself never does).

    `send_alert` is always called from a background thread and is wrapped
    so an exception in it can't crash that thread or the caller — it's
    routed to this plugin's own `on_error`, the same as any other plugin
    hook that raises.
