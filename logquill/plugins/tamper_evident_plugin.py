    same hash-chain construction used by tamper-evident/append-only logs:
    editing or deleting any one line breaks every hash after it in the
    chain, even if the tamperer edits the file directly and not through
    this plugin. Opt-in — hashing every record has a real, measurable CPU
    cost, so it isn't part of the default pipeline.

    Verify a previously-written log with `TamperEvidentPlugin.verify_chain`,
    which re-derives each record's hash from its content and confirms it
    matches both the stored `meta.hash` and the chain built from the
    records before it, in order (`logquill verify <file>` wraps this).
    `verify_chain_detailed` reports *where* and *why* a chain broke instead
    of a bare `bool`.

    deletes the last N lines leaves a perfectly self-consistent, just
    shorter, chain. `sign_head(key)` (or the module-level `sign_head`)
    signs the chain's current head so that can be caught too: see
