class SamplingPlugin(Plugin):
    """Keeps roughly `rate` of records (0.0-1.0), dropping the rest.

    With `transports` set, sampling becomes tail-based per trace: a record
    that would otherwise be dropped is buffered under its `meta[trace_key]`
    value instead of discarded outright. If any later record sharing that
    trace id reaches `elevate_at` or above, the whole trace is "elevated" —
    every buffered record for that trace id is flushed straight to
    `transports`, and every subsequent record for that trace id ships
    unconditionally. This is what lets a sampled-out request still produce
    a complete trace once it turns out to matter (it errored).

    Flushing writes buffered records directly to `transports` — pass the
    same list given to the `Logger`. This bypasses `before_log`/`after_log`/
    `on_error` for any plugin *after* `SamplingPlugin` in the pipeline (the
    plugins before it already ran, since that's how the buffered record was
    built); put `SamplingPlugin` last if that matters for your pipeline.

    Without `transports`, tail-based elevation is inactive and this behaves
    exactly like plain rate-based sampling (the original behavior) — a
    record without `meta[trace_key]` is also just rate-sampled, since there's
    no trace to buffer it under.

    Buffering is bounded: at most `max_buffered_records` records total and
    `max_traces` distinct trace ids are held at once. Once either limit is
    hit, the oldest buffered trace is evicted (and its records are lost, not
    flushed) — a deliberate bounded-memory trade-off, not a bug: an
    unbounded per-trace buffer would let a single pathologically long-lived
    or high-cardinality trace grow memory without limit.
