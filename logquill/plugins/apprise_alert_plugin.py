    notification services (Discord, Telegram, Teams, ntfy, Matrix, SMS
    gateways, ...) from one URL each — so "can it alert to X?" is answered
    by Apprise's service list rather than a bespoke plugin per service.

    Requires the optional dependency: `pip install logquill[apprise]`.
    `SlackAlertPlugin` and `PagerDutyAlertPlugin` remain the better choice
    for those two services, where a purpose-built plugin can format richer
    messages than Apprise's generic title-and-body interface.

    Like every `AlertingPlugin`, alerts go out on a background thread and a
    failure (an unreachable service, a rejected credential) is routed to
    `on_error`, never raised into the code that logged.
