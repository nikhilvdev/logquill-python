        """`async_dispatch=True` moves per-record transport writes (and the
        `after_log` plugin hooks that follow them) onto a background thread,
        via an internal `AsyncWorker` — so `.info()`/`.error()`/... return
        without waiting on a transport's I/O. `before_log` plugin hooks
        still run synchronously on the caller's thread, since they can
        filter/transform the record and a later hook or transport needs to
        see the result in order.

        `max_queue_size`/`backpressure` are only meaningful with
        `async_dispatch=True` — see `AsyncWorker` for what each
        `backpressure` policy does under a sustained burst.

        `flush_at_exit=True` (the default) drains queued records and closes
        this logger's transports when the interpreter exits, so a script that
        ends without calling `close()` doesn't lose its last records or a
        batching transport's unsent batch. Pass `False` if you manage
        shutdown yourself. It runs on a normal exit (end of script,
        `sys.exit()`, an unhandled exception) but not when the process is
        killed outright (`SIGKILL`, `os._exit()`, or `SIGTERM` with no
        handler installed) — handle `SIGTERM` and call `close()` for that.

        `content_policy` governs the content fields — an LLM call's prompt/
        completion, a tool call's arguments/result, a span's captured state
        (see `logquill.privacy.CONTENT_FIELDS`) — **`"off"` by default**:
        every call site, this logger's own plugins, and every transport
        never see the raw value unless you choose otherwise. `"hash"`
        replaces it with a stable digest (same content, same hash, so two
        records can be confirmed to share one without exposing it);
        `"truncate"` keeps the first `logquill.privacy.TRUNCATE_CHARS`
        characters; `"full"` passes it through. Applied before any plugin
        sees the record, so no plugin — not even a custom one — can
        override it; see `logquill.privacy` for the full explanation and
        `AuditLogger` for a profile that bundles this with the other
        privacy/integrity controls.

        them explicitly to adopt an id handed in from elsewhere (see
        `logquill.adapters.langchain.LangChainAdapter` for an example).

        `capture_state=lambda: {...}` is called on entering and on leaving the
        block, and what changed between the two is recorded as
        `meta.state_diff` (`{"before": ..., "after": ...}`, only the keys that
        changed when both are dicts; omitted if nothing did). The values are
        deep-copied, so an in-place mutation is seen; a state that can't be
        copied, or a callable that raises, just means no `state_diff`. It's
        stored in `meta`, so a redaction plugin that recurses (`PIIRedactPlugin`)
        sees it, but `RedactPlugin` only matches top-level keys.
