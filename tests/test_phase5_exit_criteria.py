"""End-to-end tests matching Phase 5's exit criteria verbatim (CLAUDE.md):

1. A full agent run (5+ steps, at least one nested span) reconstructs exact
   order and nesting when sorted by `meta.span_id`/`meta.parent_span_id`.
2. A synthetic multi-service call chain shares one `trace_id` end to end.
3. A `LangChainAdapter`-instrumented chain reconstructs its exact call tree
   with zero manual instrumentation beyond passing the handler in once —
   covered separately in `tests/test_adapters/test_langchain_adapter.py`,
   since it needs the optional-dependency faking setup that lives there.
